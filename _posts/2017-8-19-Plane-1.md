title: People on a Political Plane 1
description: Introduction and motivation
---

All throughout the world, people have incredibly varied political beliefs. There exist issues however, that many people are quite polarized upon despite the fact that there exist intermediate positions.

The goal of this series is to explore a hypothetical political model that predicts changes in beliefs at a large scale. 

So, why the name _People on a Political Plane_ Here is where we begin! First, imagine a coordinate plane:

![Coordinate Plane][1]

In this context, you may heavily relate the above image to a political chart:

![Political Chart][2]

That connection is indeed correct! However, we are going to take a few jumps of abstraction. Instead, imagine a cartesian plane with $n\in \mathbb{N} \$ **objects**:

![Object Cartesian Plane][5]

We will encounter a formal definition of an object in a later post as we explore the properties of such objects. In terms of reality, these objects represent people. With how we will set up our mathematics, it is useful to imagine the points as being polar coordinates. However, since the cartesian coordinate system is so intuitive (especially politically), we will keep that as our background:

![Polar Plane][6]

It is easy to see that in this case, $r = \sqrt{2}$ and $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4} = 45^{\circ}$. What is the intuition behind putting it on the polar plane? Politically, the unit circle maps to different ideologies:

![Ideology Unit Circle][7]

Different angles with arbitrary $\theta$ represent different ideologies with different scalings from the unit circle representing how "radical" the ideology is (maybe "strong" is a better word there). This is JUST like a normal polar coordinate system. Remember, we are only dealing with abstract mathematics right now so we can pretend this whole ideology mapping thing doesn't exist. I only brought it up to incite some motivation into what we are doing so I'm not just simply explaining a polar coordinate system to you.

How does this relate to our overall goal though? We want to look at _changes_ in beliefs, not just classifications of them. That is why next time, we will be looking at **transformations**! How exciting... I'll be writing that soon. For the period in between, think about this: relative to you, where are the people you know politically on this polar scale? Are their beliefs stronger or weaker than yours? Do note, at the point we are at now, it's all subjective. I just don't want you to lose sight of our original intentions.

Also note, this extends to more dimensions than two and we will be talking about that. Actually, we _have_ to increase the number of dimensions if we want to accomplish some of our goals as we will see later.
