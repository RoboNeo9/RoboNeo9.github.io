title: People on a Political Plane 2
description: Transformations

Beliefs aren't usually static. They change based upon many different factors from environmental positions to discourse with another person.

_Note to the reader: I accidentally chose very bad "calculation" numbers. Be aware that I used a calculator for every calculation in this post. Use the approximations. Don't get hung up on the numbers. Take in the concepts instead._

So today, as I promised, we will be looking into **transformations**. As a refresher, what do transformations represent? _A change in beliefs._ There are two fundamental kinds of transformations that we can do to a point $P$:
- $\varphi_P(\theta)$: a counterclockwise rotation of $P$ about the orgin by $\theta$
- $R_ P(r)$: a scale from the orgin by $r$

I will usually notate these transformations together in two equivalent ways as either $T_{\theta,r}(P)$ or $T_P \left ( \theta, r \right )$ depending on which notation is easier to read at the time.

Let's do some examples. Here, we have point $P$. It is represented in cartesian coordinates as $(4,3)$ and $\left ( \arctan\left ( \frac{3}{4} \right ),5 \right )$ or $\left ( 36.87^{\circ} , 5 \right )$:

Here we have three transformations of $P$: 

$P'_ 1 = T_P \left ( \frac{\pi}{2} , 1 \right ) = T_P \left ( 90^\circ , 1 \right )$

$P'_ 2 =  T_P \left ( 109.44^\circ, 1.62 \right )$

$P'_ 3 = T_P \left ( 349.86^\circ, 0.22 \right )$

One could also say that I included the transformation $P = T_P \left ( 0, 0 \right )$, which is the identity transformation.

Fun fact: $T_P \left ( \theta, r \right )$ defines a group. _If you don't know what a group is, that is fine. Just ignore this fact._

- Operation: $T_P \left ( \theta_1, r_1 \right )+T_P \left ( \theta_2, r_2 \right ) = T_P \left ( \theta_1+\theta_2\mod 2\pi , r_1 r_2 \right )$ 
- Identity: $e_P = T_P \left ( 0, 0 \right )$
- Inverse: $-T_P \left ( \theta, r \right ) = T_P \left ( -\theta, r^{-1} \right )$
